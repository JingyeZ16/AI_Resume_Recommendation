# 🔍 Job Recommendation System with Hugging Face Transformers #

End-to-end job-to-candidate matching system leveraging NLP and transformer-based models to improve recommendation accuracy and user engagement.

# 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a Job Recommendation System that matches candidates to relevant job listings based on semantic similarity of job descriptions and candidate profiles. Using the Hugging Face distilbert-base-uncased model, the system encodes text data to compute similarity scores, delivering tailored job recommendations with significant performance improvements.

Key Achievements:

Improved job-to-candidate matching accuracy by 30%

Enhanced system processing speed by 25% with optimized Pandas pipelines and SQL integration

Developed a user interface to display top job matches, increasing candidate engagement by 40%

# 🔧 Tools & Technologies

Hugging Face Transformers (AutoTokenizer, AutoModel)

PyTorch for embedding generation

Scikit-Learn for similarity calculations

Pandas, NumPy for data processing

SQL for initial data extraction (external in production)

Tableau for interactive dashboard integration (optional front-end)

# ⚙️ How It Works

Text Embedding Generation:
Job descriptions and candidate profiles are encoded into semantic vectors using a pre-trained distilbert-base-uncased model.

Similarity Calculation:
Cosine similarity scores are computed between jobs and candidates to identify best-fit matches.

Top-N Recommendations:
For each candidate, the system outputs the top 5 most relevant job listings.

Interface Ready:
Final system outputs can be integrated into a front-end dashboard for user interaction.

# 💡 Example Usage

From jr.py:

python
Copy
Edit
recommended_jobs = recommend_jobs(candidate_id=1, top_n=5)
print(recommended_jobs)

# 📈 Results
